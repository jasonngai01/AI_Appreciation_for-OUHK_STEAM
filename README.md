# AI_Appreciation_for-OUHK_STEAM

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. In the recent years, AI becomes popular in different industries to increase the effectiveness and efficiency

Compared with classic methods, AI is a novel technology to do all the work. However, there is a lack of interesting applications to be used to share knowledge with students. The AI application workshops could be a solution to the issue.

In this course, students will explore the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning using programming, whilst training a machine in different contexts, using different types of data and neural networks to solve the problem.

Students will use the Google Colaboratory (Colab), a product from Google Research, to conduct machine learning, such as weather prediction, image classification, etc.

In the mini lecture, students will learn the fundamentals of AI and deep learning, such as the defunction of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), concept and setup of neural networks, how to prepare the dataset and evaluate the network.

Also, There are 2 demonstrations in the lectures. The first one is to use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the weather in Hong Kong. And the second one is to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to build the classifier for handwritten digits. The demonstration code will be shown in the Colab notebook.

In the workshop, there are 2 tutorial activities to let students taste the AI. The first one is to create an AI doctor to determine the Flu, Covid, Allergy and Cold using the ANN. The second one is to create a Paper, Rock and scissors image classifier to classify the image.

After the course, students would have experience in applying the AI technology and be able to build the custom dataset and train their own model to handle simple maker projects in daily life.
