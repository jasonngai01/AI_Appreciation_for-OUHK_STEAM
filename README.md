# AI_Appreciation_for-OUHK_STEAM

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

In the recent years, AI becomes popular in different industries to increase the effectiveness and efficiency

Comparing with classic methods, AI is a novel technology to do all the works. However, there is a lack of interesting applications to be used to share knowledge with students.  The AI application workshops could be a solution to the issue.

Students will explore the importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning  using programming, whilst training a machine in different contexts, using different types of data and Networks to solve the problem. 

Student will use the Google Colaboratory (Colab), product from Google Research, to conduct the machine learning, such as image classicification and object detection. 

In the mini lecture, students will learn the fundamental of AI and deep learning, such as the defunction of ANN and CNN, concept and setup of neural neworks, how to prepare the dataset and evaluate the network. 

Theere are 2 demostrations in the lectures. The first one is to use ANN to predict the weather in Hong Kong. And the second one is to build the classifier for handwrite digits. 

At the same times, demonstration will be shown in the Colab notebook. 

In the workshop, there are 2 activities to let students taste the AI. The first one is to create a AI doctor to determine the Flu, Covid, Allergy and Cold using the ANN. The second one is to create a Paper, Rock and scissors image classifier to classifier the image. 

After the course, students would have experience in applying the AI technology and able to build the custom dataset and train their own model to handle simple maker project in daily life.
